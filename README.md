# InstacartDataAnalysis

## Overview
Instacart stakeholders are particularly focused on the diversity of customers in their database and their shopping habits. They understand that a one-size-fits-all marketing approach may not be effective and are exploring the idea of a targeted marketing strategy. Their goal is to direct relevant marketing campaigns at specific customer groups to assess the impact on product sales. As data analysts, we will help shape this strategy by identifying the most suitable customer profiles and matching them with appropriate products. The stakeholders are looking for answers to several key questions to guide their efforts. 

## Business Objectives

- The sales team needs to identify the busiest days and times (i.e., when orders peak) to strategically place ads during slower periods.
- They also want insights into whether there are specific times of day when customers tend to spend more, as this could help in choosing which products to promote during these times.
- Instacart offers a wide range of products at varying price points, so the marketing and sales teams are considering simpler price range groupings to streamline their focus.
- Are certain product categories more popular than others?
- How frequently customers return to Instacart?
- Do ordering patterns differ depending on a customer's loyalty status?
- Are there regional differences in customer ordering habits?
- Is there a relationship between age, family status, and ordering behavior?
- What insights does the demographic data reveal? Age? Income? Types of goods? Family status?
- What differences can be observed in the ordering habits of various customer profiles?
